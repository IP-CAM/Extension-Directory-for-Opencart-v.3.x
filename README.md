# Extension Directory for Opencart 3
A small extension for developing extensions in a separate directory from core. Works by creating the least amount possible of symbolic links between the two directories.

Install either via `/system/` folder or by renaming it to install.xml, zipping to `opencart3-extension-directory.ocmod.zip` and uploading it.

In-production use not recommended.
